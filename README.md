# üí´ About Me:
Hi! I'm Tanish Srinivasan, a web developer and a tech enthusiast with a passion for crafting clean, user-friendly, and responsive web interfaces. My journey in web development started with small projects like  Netflix Clone, which allowed me to hone my skills in HTML and CSS while recreating the visual essence of popular websites.

I believe in the power of consistent learning and challenging myself to grow in the ever-evolving field of technology. From exploring the nuances of front-end development to diving deeper into full-stack solutions, my goal is to build impactful projects that leave a lasting impression.


When I'm not coding, you‚Äôll likely find me indulging in photography, playing cricket, or discovering new music. Feel free to connect with me if you have any feedback, suggestions, or just want to chat about tech and creativity!
